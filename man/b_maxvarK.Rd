\title{Maximum Variance of Kernel Matrix}
\usage{
b_maxvarK(onehot_data, sampled, max_search_b = NULL, useasbases)
}
\arguments{
\item{onehot_data}{a matrix of one-hot encoded categorical data where rows are all units and columns are one-hot encoded categorical covariates. Refer to \code{one_hot()} to produce.}

\item{sampled}{numeric vector indexing which rows off onehot_data are sample units. Of length equal to the total number of units where sampled/control units take a value of 1 and population/treated units take a value of 0.}

\item{max_search_b}{the maximum b searched during maximization. Default is 2000}

\item{useasebases}{binary vector specifying what observations are to be used in forming bases (columns) of the kernel matrix. Suggested default is: if the number of observations is under 4000, use all observations; when the number of observations is over 4000, use the sampled (control) units only.}
}
\value{
\item{b_maxvar}{numeric b value which produces the maximum variance of K}
\item{var_K}{numeric maximum variance of K found with \code{b_maxvar}}
}
\description{
Searches for the argmax of the variance of the Kernel matrix
